## A proper signing-in process is finally available in v1.2.5!

If you have an existing userid that you would like to use with your new account, here's how:

1. Go to the [MTGAHelper website](https://mtgahelper.com) and click on the `Sign-in` button in the top right corner.

2. The simplest is to use an external provider. You can authenticate directly with either a Google or Facebook account. 
Or you can create a local account by signing-up first. Once your email is verified, you can sign-in with the email/password boxes.

3. Once logged in on the website, you should normally keep your previously used userid. If your data does not appear, go in your Profile:

You can change your userid if necessary.

4. Start the tracker and you will now be able to sign-in there with the same method.

And that's it! Your data should sync properly to the userid that you've seen on your profile page. This id will soon be hidden as we can now enjoy a standard signing-in with an email account.

If you encounter any problem signing-in or retrieving your previous data, hit me up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GTd3RMd) and I'll be there to help :)
