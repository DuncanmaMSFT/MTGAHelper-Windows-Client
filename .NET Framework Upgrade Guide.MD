## Important!

#### If you installed the preview7 version of the Microsoft .NET Core 3.0 framework, you will need to uninstall it and install the official release

The Microsoft .NET Core 3.0 framework has been officially released on September 23.

Prior to this date, the tracker was using a preview version of the Framework, so it should be uninstalled.

<hr />

1. Uninstall the preview version from your computer:

2. Install the official version (same as Step 1. from installation guide):

- [This version if you have a 64-bit Operating System (x64-based processor)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-windows-x64-installer)
- [This version if you have a 32-bit Operating System (x86-based processor)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-windows-x86-installer)

Now you should see the new version installed on your system:

And you can run the tracker again :)
