                What led me to creating this? It all started a long time ago when I tried out a certain card game in high school.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                I can clearly remember thinking I had a very cool deck at the time: a white milling deck. Pretty awful in retrospect but that's how I learned to both play and love Magic...I eventually moved on to other activities and stopped playing.

                <LineBreak />
                In 2018, <Run Text="Magic: The Gathering Arena" FontWeight="Bold" />'s Beta reared its head and I was instantly hooked again by the greatest card game ever created. In all that time between high school and then, I also happened to become a programmer.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                I started writing programs to help me analyze my data - collection, matches played, decks over all the web and such — and after a few months it came to become what is now known as MTGAHelper.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                I wanted to share the tools I am building with all the others MTGA enthusiasts out there. I hope you enjoy it!
